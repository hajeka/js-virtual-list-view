js-virtual-list-view
====================

A generic HTML component for rendering very large lists. Supports variable height elements. Currently depends on jQuery and _ (underscore) and we can consider refactoring those dependencies based on demand. Collaborators are needed. For example, I am not planning to add touch support for the scroll gesture until I need it, but someone else might want to do that.
